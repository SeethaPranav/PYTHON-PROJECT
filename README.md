# PYTHON-PROJECT
A comprehensive analysis of employee data, focusing on salary distribution, team composition, player demographics, and predictive modeling to uncover key insights and trends.

This project focuses on analyzing employee data within a company to uncover key patterns and insights related to team distribution, salary expenditure, and employee demographics. The goal is to better understand the workforce structure and dynamics through data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. 

**Methods used in this project include:**

**Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Cleaning the "Height" Column**: Replaced any invalid or inconsistent height data with random values between 150 and 180.
  - **Replacing Null Values in the Salary Column**: Filled missing salary values with the mean salary of the entire dataset.
  - **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Removed duplicate entries and ensured all columns have consistent data types while correcting anomalies such as negative ages or salaries.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - **Distribution of Employees Across Teams**: Analyzed how employees are distributed across different teams and their percentage representation.
  - **Segregation by Position**: Categorized employees by their position to understand the breakdown of roles within the company.
  - **Predominant Age Group**: Identified the most prominent age group within the workforce.
  - **Salary Analysis by Team and Position**: Analyzed salary expenditures to determine which teams and positions have the highest salary allocations.
  - **Correlation Between Age and Salary**: Investigated the relationship between employee age and salary to understand if there is any significant correlation.

- **Visualization**: 
  - Used **bar charts**, **pie charts**, **scatter plots**, and **heatmaps** to visually represent the data and insights from the analysis, aiding in the interpretation of patterns and trends.
